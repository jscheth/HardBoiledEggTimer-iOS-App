# HardBoiledEggTimer

## Overview
HardBoiledEggTimer is an iOS learning project built using Swift. The app provides a simple way to set a countdown timer for boiling eggs to different levels of doneness. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as conditionals, dictionaries, timers, and progress bars.

## Features
- Select the desired egg hardness: Soft, Medium, or Hard.
- Uses a dictionary to store predefined cooking times.
- Implements a countdown timer to track boiling time.
- Displays a progress bar that updates in real-time.
- Provides visual feedback when the timer completes.

## Technologies Used
- **Swift**: The programming language used for development.
- **UIKit**: For building the user interface.
- **Timer**: To implement the countdown functionality.
- **ProgressView**: To visually represent the time remaining.
- **If-Else Statements**: Used for logic control.
- **Dictionary**: Used to store egg cooking times.

## How It Works
1. User selects an egg hardness level.
2. The app retrieves the corresponding cooking time from a dictionary.
3. A timer starts counting down from the selected time.
4. The progress bar updates dynamically as the timer runs.
5. When the timer reaches zero, the app displays a "DONE!" message.

## Learning Objectives
This project is designed for learners looking to:
- Understand how to use dictionaries in Swift.
- Implement and manage timers.
- Work with UI elements such as buttons, labels, and progress bars.
- Apply basic if-else logic for decision-making.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jscheth/HardBoiledEggTimer-iOS-App.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Run the app on an iOS simulator or a physical device.
4. Select an egg hardness level to start the timer.
